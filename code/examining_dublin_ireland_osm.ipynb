There is a wider selection of possible street endings to choose from and the elements that are difficult are singletons in the dataset."

    "####Postcodes\n",
    "While there was no real issue with street name endings, wrangling the postcodes proved a considerable task in this dataset. Some background: a new postcode system is being introduced in Ireland currently, but Dublin has had its own postcodes for many years.\n",
    "\n",
    "The postcodes are important to Dublin's own sense of identity - all the even-numbered postcodes are to the south of the river Liffey, and all the odd-numbered postcodes to the north. Being a Northsider or Southsider is quite a point of pride in the city. However, there is no postcode key among the three million data points in the dublin_ireland.osm dataset. Not one.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is, however, an *addr:city* key in the dataset, and this proved to be where most postcodes had been recorded. The recording was very haphazard though, and the *addr:city* key contained a mix of postcodes proper, districts of the city, the names of many of the satellite towns that surround Dublin, or else just the single word \"Dublin\" itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "To put this in order, I wrote a function called *find_dublin_postcodes()* that took a link from the [Irish Post Office](https://www.anpost.ie/AnPost/AnPostDM/ProductsAndServices/Publicity+Post/DublinDeliveryZones/Dublin+Delivery+Zones.htm) and used the *BeautifulSoup* module on data from that link to form an initial list of official Dublin post codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then iterated that Post Office list against the values for *addr:city* to identify which districts or postcodes weren't on the offical list. I created a .json file of these outliers, read the .json back as a dict and used both dictionaries in another function, *fix_postcode()*, that identified the *addr:city* as a postcode, a Dublin district or a satellite town, and amended the *shape_element()* function appropriately."

Although everybody in Ireland speaks English, the official first language of the state is Irish, or Gaelic. The *name:ga* key in the dataset means the value will be a placename’s Gaelic translation, but it’s also possible that the placename itself is in Gaelic. A Gaelic word has to be coded as Unicode which could have caused issues when writing to the .json file, but happily the codecs module took care of this."
